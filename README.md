This is a newsletter web application where you can email people who are interested in your product. It is a single page, and the frontend was developed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. The main page will have a submit form containing the username and email address. The backend side was developed using Express.js and the Mailchimp Marketing API (https://mailchimp.com/developer/), which is used to store and manage the email subscription list. This newsletter web app will allow people to sign up for your mailing list. After submitting the form, the data will be sent to the server, which will make a post request to the Mailchimp Marketing API with the intention of saving the data there. If successful, the user will be redirected to a successful website, and if this process fails, the user will be redirected to a failure website with an option to go back and submit the data again. The whole process is integrated with MailChimp, which gives us the option of managing our subscription email lists. This is a perfect example of how to use Express.js with APIs, and post data to communicate with the server.
